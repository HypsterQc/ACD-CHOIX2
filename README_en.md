# INF4500 // Bioinformatics

In the INF4500 course, I learn the basic concepts of bioinformatics, including biological sequence analysis, phylogeny, and RNA structures. I explore algorithms for sequence comparison and alignment, as well as methods for genome modeling. Practical assignments involve using bioinformatics tools on Linux and experimenting with real biological data.
